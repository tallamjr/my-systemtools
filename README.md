#My System Tools

This repo is a collection of my own versions of UNIX/Linux system tools implemented in
a variety of languages in order to improve my understanding of UNIX/Linux
systems and the languages they are implemented in.

*NOTE* 
Ideas and some code examples taken from Linux User \& Developer Magazine
